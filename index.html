      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2012, Learn to Grow wanted to provide education resources for those without, while still benefiting the environment. In college, founders Tori Montagna and Emilia Cie≈õla were going through paper supplies like water. Often disposing copious paper drafts, there was a worrisome amount of excess waste. They felt as though this unnecessary waste was the jumping off point for the future of education. Product development began immediately, in which they developed paper that contained seeds. After the paper was used, it could be disposed of outside where the seeds could flourish and grow anew. Through our products, the more you learn, the more you support the natural world - the bridge between the gap of education and the environment.</p>
      <h3>Our Impact</h3>
      <p>It started with just individual sheets of paper, but now has grown to notebooks, textbooks, index cards, etc... We now have products used in 6/7 continents, and with over 2 million people our products have reached. Thousands of schools and institutions have sourced our products to benefit education and the environment. </p>
